#### Challenges
Implementing a basic emoji picker was not hard and the parts that I found challenging while creating this project were
* Learning a new library React-tether in a short time.
* Styling the emoji picker pop-up component.

#### Trade-offs
* Displaying emoji name inside the EmojiPicker component instead of in a tooltip box, on mouse hover.
* Did not implement other extra features like search, emoji skin-tone because of time constraint.
